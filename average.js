// Problem #1 - .map and .reduce
// Find the average price of all items in the items array.

// You should use both .map and .reduce to:

// 1. Create a new array using Array.map() that is filled with only item prices.
// 2. Use the Array.reduce() method to get the sum of all prices.



// change this from null to be the final average price of all items.
const average = null;

// Do not touch:
document.getElementById('answer1').innerHTML = average;
